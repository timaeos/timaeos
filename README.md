# Introduction 

Hello whoever has stumbled upon this page.

I’m **@timaeos**. I'm relatively new to contributing to the open source community. My education is in the chemical engineering field with only minor hobbyist
experience in programming and computer technology. I've decided to try to transition my career back to my hobbyist roots.

I'm self-employed at the moment with the intention of working on a personal project that I hope to launch in late 2022. 

A secondary project I'll be working on is an onboarding website to help expose computer users to desktop linux called [linux, btw.](https://linuxbtw.me)
I'll eventually create a git repository for the website so that others can contribute to it but I've only started the planning stage at the moment.

I'm learning Go, Rust, and Javascript (specifically NodeJS, Vue). My original programming experience was in Java and TCL scripting.
